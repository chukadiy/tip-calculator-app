## Overview

## Hello

I use [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges to help me improve my coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

My challenge was to build out the tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## Building the project

I could use any tools I know to help me complete the challenge, but I choose to build using Vuejs framework

### Where to find everything

My task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs which means that I needed to use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There was also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information I needed, such as color palette and fonts.


### My process

Below is a process, I used in building this project:

1. I initialized my project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo to make it easier to share my code.
2. I configure my repository to publish my code to a web address.
3. I looked through the designs to start planning out how to tackle the project. This step was crucial to help me think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, I structured my content with HTML. Writing your HTML first helped me focus my attention on creating well-structured content.
5. I wrote out the base styles for the project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. I started adding styles to the top of the page and worked my way down, moving on to the next section only when I'm a bit satisfied with the area I am working on.
7. I deployed to netlify app.[netlify](app.netlify.com). Deploying vue to netlify makes it easier to show how it works on live.
